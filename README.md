A Gradient Boosted Decision Tree that predicts the review rating score using airbnb data.

Started by choosing the AirBnB listings dataset, and then chose a label. With my label, I knew that it was a supervised learning problem.

By choosing the label of review scores rating, this would help predict based on other data whether or not a particular listing was good or bad. To have this information means that the website can reccomend listings that are likely to have a good review score so that those are chosen, and will keep customer retention since they have good experience if they choose ones with good ratings.

I chose a gradient boosted decision tree as my model because it is a regression problem, and there were a lot of features as well. I checked to see how correct my model was with RMSE and R^2 values.
